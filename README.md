# Email-To-Name-Python
A simple python script that parses first names and last names from emails (and that's not all folks, a flask-wrapped web api you can get running in minutes, that you can use to parse names from emails... And that's not all folks! A docker app that will launch the flask wrapped name to email parsing python script).
