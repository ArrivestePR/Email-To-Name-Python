# Email-To-Name-Python
A simple python script that parses first names and last names from emails (and that's not all folks, an extra script that's a ready to go flask-wrapped web API you can get running in minutes - find this in the "email-to-name-python-flask" folder that you can use to parse names from emails via a convenient web API... And that's not all folks! A docker app that will launch the flask wrapped email to name parsing python script and allow you to have your own email to name web API running in a docker container in minutes - find this in the "email-to-name-dockerized" folder).

This is a v0.1 of the script and we're sure other coders who're far more skilled, handsome, humble and patient than us have made better scripts. But this is our attempt to solve this problem we face at our small company: ArrivistePR, check us out: https://arrivistepr.com/
